# ATM Encapsulation Project

## Overview

This project is a simple simulation of an ATM system developed in Java using the concept of **Encapsulation**. It demonstrates how to securely manage an account balance through controlled access methods like deposit, withdrawal, and balance display.

## Features

- **Show Balance**: View the current available balance.
- **Deposit Money**: Add funds to the account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Withdraw funds from the account with balance validation.
- **Menu-driven Console Application**: User-friendly text menu to interact with the ATM.
- **Input Validation**: Prevents invalid deposits or withdrawals.
- **Encapsulation**: All account data (balance) is private and only accessible via public methods.

## Project Structure

- `JavaProject.Lab.Hard.ATM`: Contains the ATM class with encapsulated balance and related methods.
- `JavaProject.Lab.Medium.Test`: Contains the `main` method with the menu and user interaction logic.

---

## How to Run

1. Compile both classes (`ATM.java` and `Test.java`).
2. Run the `Test` class.
3. Follow the on-screen menu to deposit, withdraw, or check your balance.

## Future Improvements

- Add PIN-based authentication for security.
- Implement transaction history.
- Support multiple user accounts.
